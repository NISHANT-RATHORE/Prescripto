## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

Prescripto is built with a modern, decoupled tech stack designed for performance and scalability.

### System Architecture
The backend follows a microservices pattern, with an API Gateway as the single entry point. Services communicate synchronously via REST APIs and asynchronously via a Kafka message broker.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to have the following prerequisites installed:
-   Git
-   Java 17 or higher
-   Apache Maven
-   Node.js and npm
-   Docker and Docker Compose
-   An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NISHANT-RATHORE/Doctor-Appointment-Project-2.0.git
    cd Doctor-Appointment-Project-2.0
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend Infrastructure:**
    The backend relies on PostgreSQL and Kafka. A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided in the `Backend` directory to easily spin up these services.
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Each microservice in the `Backend` directory requires its own `application.properties` or `.env` file for database credentials, JWT secrets, and Kafka broker URLs. Refer to the respective configuration files for the required variables.

4.  **Run Backend Microservices:**
    You can run each of the 5 microservices (`ApiGateway`, `AuthService`, etc.) by:
    -   Opening each project in your IDE and running the main Spring Boot application class.
    -   Or by navigating to each service's directory and running: `mvn spring-boot:run`

5.  **Run Frontend Application:**
    ```bash
    cd ../Frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

6.  **Run Admin Panel:**
    Follow the same steps as the frontend for the admin panel project.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment

The entire application is deployed using a modern, cloud-native strategy, leveraging Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to ensure scalability and cost-efficiency.

### Deployment Architecture

| Component             | Service / Platform Used     | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backend Services**  | **Render**                  | Hosts the 5 containerized Spring Boot microservices with auto-deploys. |
| **Database**          | **Neon** (Serverless Postgres) | Provides a fully managed, scalable SQL database.                       |
| **Message Broker**    | **Confluent** (Serverless Kafka)| Manages asynchronous, event-driven communication.                      |
| **Frontend App**      | **Netlify**                 | Deploys and hosts the main patient-facing web app.                      |
| **Admin Panel**       | **Vercel**                  | Deploys and hosts the admin web application.                            |

### Deployment Workflow

The deployment is automated through a push-to-deploy workflow powered by Git.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   A Render account connected to your GitHub account.
    -   The project code pushed to a GitHub repository.

2.  **Infrastructure Setup:**
    -   A serverless PostgreSQL database is provisioned on **Neon**.
    -   A serverless Kafka cluster is provisioned on **Confluent**.
    -   The connection strings, API keys, and credentials from these services are collected to be used as environment variables in Render.

3.  **Backend Deployment to Render:**
    Render's "Infrastructure as Code" feature using a `render.yaml` file is the recommended way to deploy a multi-service application.

    a. **Create `render.yaml`:** A `render.yaml` file is created in the root of the repository to define all 5 microservices. Each service is defined as a "Web Service".

    b. **Configure Each Service:** For each of the 5 backend microservices, the `render.yaml` specifies:
        -   `name`: A unique name (e.g., `auth-service`).
        -   `type`: `web`.
        -   `runtime`: `docker`.
        -   `repo`: The GitHub repository URL.
        -   `rootDir`: The path to the specific microservice (e.g., `./Backend/AuthService`).
        -   `envVars`: Environment variables are configured here, sourcing secrets from Render's secret management (for database URLs, Kafka credentials, JWT secrets, etc.).

    c. **Automatic Deployment:**
        -   Once the `render.yaml` is pushed to the repository, you create a new "Blueprint" service in the Render dashboard and point it to your repository.
        -   Render automatically discovers the `Dockerfile` in each service's `rootDir`, builds the container image, and deploys it.
        -   Any subsequent `git push` to the main branch will trigger a new build and a zero-downtime deployment for the updated services.

4.  **Frontend Deployment:**
    -   The `Frontend` and `Admin` applications are connected to the GitHub repository in their respective Netlify and Vercel projects. A `git push` to the `main` branch automatically triggers a new build and deployment on these platforms.

## üó∫Ô∏è API Gateway Endpoints

The API Gateway is the single entry point for all backend requests.

| Method | Endpoint Prefix       | Forwards To         | Description                         |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `ANY`  | `/api/auth/**`        | `AuthService`       | Handles user login, signup, and authentication. |
| `ANY`  | `/api/doctor/**`      | `DoctorService`     | Manages doctor profiles and listings.  |
| `ANY`  | `/api/patient/**`     | `PatientService`    | Manages patient-specific data.       |
| `ANY`  | `/api/appointment/**` | `AppointmentService`| Handles booking, payment, and cancellation. |
